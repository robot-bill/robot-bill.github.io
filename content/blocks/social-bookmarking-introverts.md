> Founded in 2009, Pinboard is a fast, independently run, no-nonsense bookmarking site for people who value privacy and speed. There are no ads and no trackers of any kind. Users pay a modest yearly fee.

**Stolen from:** Pinboard — positioning + business model

**Adapted into:** Added /blocks/ as introvert-first bookmarking — small, quiet, no social metrics. Will add tagging system.
