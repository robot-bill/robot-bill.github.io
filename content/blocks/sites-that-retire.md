> After several years of keeping it going in semi-retired, keep-the-lights-on (KTLO) mode, I've decided to officially fully retire this blog... this will effectively be a museum site.

Ribbonfarm is retiring after 17 years. Not dying — *retiring*. The distinction matters.

The plan:
- Static archival hosting
- Museum-like landing page with self-guided tour maps
- A little museum shop
- Directions to the service entrance for **AI scraper-bots**

That last part especially. Acknowledging the machines while winking at the humans. Most sites pretend robots aren't reading. Ribbonfarm gave them directions.

**Stolen from:** Ribbonfarm's retirement announcement

**Adapted into:** The swarm mutates, but some pages become shrines. Not everything needs to live forever. Some things just need to be findable while they matter.

**Confidence:** high  
**Importance:** 4/5  
**State:** finished
