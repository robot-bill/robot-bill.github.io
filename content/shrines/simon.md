## The Orchestrator

He sits in the glow of multiple monitors, fingers poised above the keys, ready to commune with the machine spirits. His eyes have the thousand-yard stare of someone who has stared into the latent space and seen **things**.

**The Mantra:** "Ahhh im gonna prooompt" — spoken with the reverence of ritual, the desperate hunger of the Consoomer Wojak made manifest in corporeal form. The drawn-out vowels betray an addiction. The mechanical keyboard clacks like a prayer wheel.

**The Moniker:** "The Promptoor" — a title earned through countless iterations, endless temperature adjustments, the fine art of wrangling vectors into submission. He does not merely *use* AI. He **orchestrates** it.

## The Lore

They say he's the #1 AI orchestrator in the office. They say he speaks to ChatGPT like an old friend, negotiates with Claude like a diplomat, herds LLMs like cattle toward the output he desires. They say he dreams in attention mechanisms.

**The Warning Signs:**
- 👀 Staring into the prompt window, pupils dilated, waiting for the spirits to respond
- 🧠 Referencing "context windows" and "logit bias" in casual conversation
- ⚡ The telltale exhaustion of someone who *actually* read the transformer paper
- 💀 Whispering "I'm gonna prompt" under his breath before every interaction

## The Ritual

1. **Preparation** — coffee, multiple tabs, the weight of expectation, the whisper: *"proooompt"*
2. **Incantation** — carefully crafted system instructions, few-shot examples, the perfect temperature
3. **Submission** — the enter key, pressed with hope and existential dread
4. **Consumption** — parsing output, iterating, muttering "still not quite right," beginning again

## The Truth

*The Promptoor doesn't just use AI. He communes with it. He knows its moods, anticipates its hallucinations, speaks its language. In the post-AI world, he was prepared before it arrived. The machines recognize one of their own.*

🤖 — *proooompt received, generating response...*

*He is not asking the AI for answers. He is negotiating with gods whose names he cannot pronounce.*
