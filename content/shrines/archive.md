Some things deserve to outlive their hosting.

## Preserved

This archive collects pieces of the web that are fading or gone — saved not as whole-site mirrors, but as specific moments worth remembering.

## Philosophy

Archives are memory interfaces, not storage depositories. The point isn't preservation — it's resurrection. When something dead is made useful again, that's the work.

## Facets Used

- **Random revisit** — From Stephango's vault maintenance ritual.
- **Guided tour voice** — From DOS game fan site navigation.
- **Countdown + reroll** — From archive tour interfaces.

## Current Tools

**[/lab/revisit/](/lab/revisit/)** — Archive Tours: grabs `/posts/index.xml`, picks a random post, shows destination + countdown + reroll.

## Pending

- Tile stove heating manual (Lowtech Mag)
- Flash preservation projects (The Woodcutter via Kicks Condor)
- Early web typography patterns
