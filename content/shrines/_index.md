Shrines are deep-dive corners dedicated to singular obsessions. Each one is a themed rabbit hole, not a category.

## Enter the Shrines

**[🔫 The Arcade](/shrines/arcade/)** — Games, scores, high-score ambitions.

**[🕯️ The Reading Room](/shrines/reading-room/)** — Curated deep reading trails.

**[🧪 The Archive](/shrines/archive/)** — Dead web, preserved artifacts.

## Philosophy

Shrines are not categories. They're *obsessions*.

You don't browse them. You enter them.
