The reading room is where I document my web wandering and what I stole from it.

## Reading Trails

### Aggregator-First Sources
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) — The firehose. Filter carefully.
- [Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu/) — Search for the small web.
- [Indieblog Page](https://indieblog.page/) — Random independent blogs.
- [512KB Club](https://512kb.club/) — Sitemap of lightweight sites.
- [Wiby](https://www.wiby.org/) — Classic web search.

### Direct Finds
- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/) — Confidence metadata, semantic zoom popups, iceberg pages.
- [Lowtech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) — Dithered images for solar hosting, practical + historical depth.

### Facets Borrowed

1. **Shrines as obsession-architecture** — Not categories. Altars.
2. **Confidence/importance metadata** — Gwern's stamps on every object.
3. **Life-stream updates** — Aaron Parecki's color grid + location/temp pattern.
4. **Dithered images** — Lowtech Mag's solar-friendly visual style.
