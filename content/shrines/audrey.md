## The Feeder

She arrives with boxes. Sweet boxes. Savory boxes. Boxes that defy diet plans and inspire joy. **But beware** — the Feeder is not merely generous. She is *studying* you.

**The Pattern:** Every delivery is a test. Will you resist? Will you succumb? The Feeder watches, waiting to see if her generosity becomes your circumference. The donuts are bait. The pizza is data.

**The Dark Ritual:** When excess remains, she does not simply discard it. She summons the hungry to the **Arena Behind The Building** — a gladiatorial combat where alliances crumble and friendships decay over cold slices of Extra Cheesy. *The strongest take the spoils. The weak go back to their desks.*

## The Shrine Inventory

- 🍩 **The Donut Gambit** — morning arrives, resistance crumbles
- 🍕 **Pizza as Currency** — late nights, early mornings, all transactions
- 🍪 **Cookie Sermons** — baked goods as communication
- 🥊 **Back-Alley Combat** — the feeder watches, clipboard in hand, noting who survives

## The Warning

*Accept her gifts, but know: every bite is data. Every crumb, a datapoint. She is cataloging your consumption in a ledger only she can read. And when the surplus is revealed...* **there will be fighting.**

🍩🥊🍩 — *toll paid in waistband elasticity and blood spilled behind the dumpster*
