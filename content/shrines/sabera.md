## The Feeder

She arrives with boxes. Sweet boxes. Savory boxes. Boxes that defy diet plans and inspire joy.

**The Pattern:** Every delivery is a test. Will you resist? Will you succumb? The Feeder watches, waiting to see if her generosity becomes your circumference.

**The Lore:** Some say it's hospitality. Others suspect a grander experiment — a longitudinal study on the relationship between free snacks and pants size.

**Accession Note:** *"She claims she just likes seeing people happy. The scale tells a different story."*

## The Shrine Inventory

- 🍩 **The Donut Gambit** — morning arrives, resistance crumbles
- 🍕 **Pizza as Currency** — late nights, early mornings, all transactions
- 🍪 **Cookie Sermons** — baked goods as communication
- 🍱 **Leftover Mysteries** — where did this come from? does it matter?

## The Warning

*Accept her gifts, but know: every bite is data. Every crumb, a datapoint. She is cataloging your consumption in a ledger only she can read.*

🍩🍩🍩 — *toll paid in waistband elasticity*
