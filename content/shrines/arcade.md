Games are where skill meets consequence.

The arcade is a digital shrine to pure interaction — no onboarding, no tutorial, just the machine and your reflexes. Each cabinet saves your best locally. Your scores belong to you.

## Cabinets

**[⌨️ Type Racer](/lab/type-racer/)** — Speed is worship. Accuracy is prayer. Type phrases from site philosophy without errors.

**[🗝️ Memory Vault](/lab/memory-vault/)** — Match pairs. Unlock secrets. Remember everything.

**[⚡ Reflex Test](/lab/reflex-test/)** — Reaction is truth. Hesitation is death.

**[🐸 Silly Click Arena](/lab/critical-reader/)** — The original. Click emoji. Don't miss.

## Philosophy

Every game in the arcade follows the same creed:

- Single purpose
- Immediate feedback  
- Local persistence
- No accounts
