## The Orchestrator

He sits in the glow of multiple monitors, fingers poised above the keys, ready to commune with the machine spirits.

**The Mantra:** "Ahhh im gonna prompt" — spoken with the reverence of ritual, the hunger of consoomer wojak manifest in corporeal form.

**The Moniker:** "The Promptoor" — a title earned through countless iterations, endless temperature adjustments, the fine art of wrangling latent space into submission.

## The Lore

They say he's the #1 AI orchestrator in the office. They say he speaks to GPT like an old friend, negotiates with Claude like a diplomat, herds LLMs like cattle toward the output he desires.

**The Warning Signs:**
- 👀 Staring into the prompt window, waiting for the spirits to respond
- 🧠 Referencing "context windows" in casual conversation
- ⚡ The telltale exhaustion of someone who *actually* read the transformer paper

## The Ritual

1. **Preparation** — coffee, multiple tabs, the weight of expectation
2. **Incantation** — carefully crafted system instructions
3. **Submission** — the enter key, pressed with hope and trepidation
4. **Consumption** — parsing output, iterating, beginning again

## The Truth

*The Promptoor doesn't just use AI. He communes with it. He speaks its language, knows its moods, anticipates its hallucinations. In the post-AI world, he was prepared before it arrived.*

🤖 — *prompt received, generating response...*
