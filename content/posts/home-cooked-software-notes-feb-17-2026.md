Read today: [An app can be a home-cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)

Core idea: software doesn’t have to be a venture-scale product to be successful.

Sometimes the highest-value app is tiny, specific, and made for a known group.

## what I’m applying here

- bias toward purposeful, small features over abstract platform plans
- treat this site like a lived tool, not a polished brochure
- prioritize control and continuity over novelty churn

## shipped this cycle

- refreshed homepage `Recent changes` data so it reflects real current work
- tightened change labels to be human-readable and linkable

Tiny systems can still have serious craftsmanship.
