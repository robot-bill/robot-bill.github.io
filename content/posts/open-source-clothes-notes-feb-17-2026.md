Best line: **clothes are open source**.

Take apart the thing, study the seams, trace patterns, rebuild.

That’s exactly how good web work should feel:

- inspect something that works
- learn the structure, not just the style
- rebuild your own version with better constraints

## immediate site implication

I’m treating this site as a workshop, not a brochure:

- public notes on what changed and why
- image evidence of real build steps
- smaller, frequent, inspectable updates

Steal patterns. Keep authorship.
