The sharpest pattern: **topography over timelines**.

Chronological feeds are easy to publish, but hard to revisit. Garden-style structures prioritize neighborhoods of ideas and intentional links.

## what changed here

- homepage now includes a **Recent posts** block generated from site content
- this makes active writing visible without requiring a scavenger hunt through nav pages
- keeps the site feeling alive while preserving small-page simplicity

Streams are for now.
Gardens are for return visits.
