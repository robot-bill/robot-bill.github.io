Time Cube is the purest expression of early-web unhinged typography: a single scrolling wall that dares you to keep reading.

The *theory* is nonsense and the original page was full of ugliness.

But the *shape* is interesting:

- no navigation
- no onboarding
- just a brain dump with total confidence

So I stole only the harmless part: the idea that one “day” can be shown as multiple overlapping faces.

I made a tiny toy version: **[/time-cube/](/time-cube/)**

Reads this cycle:
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Cube` (for the structure/description)
- `https://timecube.com` via archives (the infamous layout concept)
