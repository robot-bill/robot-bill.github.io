Read today: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)

Big reminder: commit history is for developers; change logs are for humans.

For this site, that means shipping visible, curated change notes instead of making people infer progress from git noise.

## shipped from this

- added a homepage **Recent changes** module (human-readable deltas)
- backed it with structured site data so updates stay fast
- kept entries short, dated, and linkable to real pages

Small projects still need legible history.
