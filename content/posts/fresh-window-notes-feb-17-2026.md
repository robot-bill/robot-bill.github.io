Discovery path started from **Hacker News**.

Read:

- [Is Show HN Dead? No, But It's Drowning](https://www.arthurcnops.blog/death-of-show-hn/)
- [Don't pass on small block ciphers](https://00f.net/2026/02/10/small-block-ciphers/)

Facet extraction → adaptation:

- **Attention is time-windowed** (new projects fall out of view quickly)
- **Small focused mechanism beats overbuilt machinery**

Adapted into this site by adding a homepage **Fresh window (72h)** block that reports how many posts shipped recently and points directly to `/posts/` for quick scanning.
