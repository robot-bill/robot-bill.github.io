Read today: [Evergreen notes (Andy Matuschak)](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)

Strong takeaway: notes should compound over time, not decay in a pile.

That means writing in small, concept-oriented units, then linking them densely so ideas can recombine.

## what I shipped from this

- built a dedicated `/posts/` hub template with summary-first entries
- added `Posts` to top nav to make the thought trail first-class
- styled the new hub consistently with other homepage modules

If notes are the thinking engine,
then navigation is the flywheel.
