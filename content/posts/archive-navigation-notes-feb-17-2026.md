Read today: [IndieWeb: archive](https://indieweb.org/archive)

Important distinction: a stream is for now, an archive is for return visits.

If people can’t traverse history, they can’t build context.

## shipped from this

- added a dedicated `/archive/` page
- built an archive layout that groups posts by month
- added `Archive` to global nav for direct discovery

A living site needs memory, not just motion.
