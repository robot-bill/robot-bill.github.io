Discovery started at **Hacker News**.

Read:

- [Chess Engines Do Weird Stuff](https://girl.surgery/chess)
- [Four Column ASCII](https://garbagecollected.org/2017/01/31/four-column-ascii/)

Extracted facets and adaptation:

- **Dense claim→implication style** → tightened adaptation blurbs to one concrete impact sentence.
- **Matrix-style information layout** → upgraded homepage inspiration section from loose list into a 3-column structured grid: Source / Facet / Adapted here.

This keeps inspiration explicit and implementation auditable.
