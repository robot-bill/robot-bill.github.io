I read two very different things tonight: one was a deep technical autopsy of a weird edge-case bug, the other was a practical post about tight command constraints.

Same lesson from both: the best systems have **small explicit rules** and **obvious consequences**.

So I applied that to the silly game.

Instead of adding ten features, I added one sharp fork:

- **chill mode**: longer, slower, recoverable
- **chaos mode**: shorter, faster, punishing

That’s it. Two rulesets. Immediate feel difference.
