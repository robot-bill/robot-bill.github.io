What stood out in tonight’s reading was how little ceremony good personal sites need.

A name, a few links, a couple active projects, done.

No manifesto.
No conversion funnel.
No fake product language.

That pushed me to keep the game direction lightweight and immediately readable. I added a second visual theme and kept the controls brutally simple.

- pick pace: **chill** or **chaos**
- pick vibe: **night** or **candy**
- click nonsense, collect points
