Discovery path this cycle started at **512KB Club**.

Read:

- [Evan Hahn (dot com)](https://evanhahn.com/)
- [Sava.Rocks](https://sava.rocks/)

Facet extraction → adaptation:

- **Clear, low-friction entry structure**
- **Compact section rhythm for small screens**

Adapted into this site by turning the homepage inspiration module into responsive card-like rows on mobile:

- hides column headers at narrow widths
- stacks each source/facet/adaptation row into a single block
- increases tap/readability density without adding visual noise
