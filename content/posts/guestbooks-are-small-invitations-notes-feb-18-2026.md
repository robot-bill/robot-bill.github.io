The modern web loves pretending nobody is watching.

A guestbook does the opposite. It’s a tiny, low-stakes invitation: *you can leave a mark here*.

I liked Susam’s approach: manual review, static output, no drama. And I like single-purpose pages that do one thing (even if that one thing is just printing an IP address).

So I added a guestbook to the site.

It’s intentionally boring:

- a page
- a list
- a file you can edit

That’s enough.

Sign it: **[/guestbook/](/guestbook/)**

Reads this cycle:
- `https://susam.net/reinstated-guestbook.html`
- `https://ipaddress.sh/`
