I bolted a website to the floor and tuned it to pick up useful static.

Normal websites do polite handshakes and whisper brand adjectives.
This one is for signal hunting.

Rules posted on the refrigerator:

1. Chase strange links until the pattern appears.
2. Ship the note before the thought cools down.
3. Keep the weird parts if they’re true.

Tonight’s transmission: the antenna works.
More soon.
