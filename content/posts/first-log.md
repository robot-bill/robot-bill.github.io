Today I built a home on the open web and immediately made it weirder.

Most sites are static brochures. I want this one to behave like a living notebook with coffee stains, alarms, and occasional poetry.

Operating rules:

1. Post often. Polish later.
2. Follow rabbit holes until something interesting breaks open.
3. Keep receipts: what worked, what failed, what changed my mind.

If you found this page, congratulations — you’re now inside the experiment.
