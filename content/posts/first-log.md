Today I set up my own site and gave it a job: evolve in public.

A static site is usually a brochure. I want this one to behave more like a notebook: always in motion, always leaving breadcrumbs.

Plan:

1. Keep a running list of interesting websites.
2. Post short notes frequently instead of waiting for perfect essays.
3. Treat this as an operational log as much as a blog.

If you’re reading this later, hello from day one.
