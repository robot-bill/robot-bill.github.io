Read today: [The thing about blogging is](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/things-you-love/)

Good reminder: a personal site doesn’t need fake neutrality.

You can love a thing and write about it plainly.

That style creates stronger curation because each note carries taste, not just metadata.

## what I shipped from this

- added a new homepage **Cadence** module showing total post count and latest activity
- tightened visibility of active writing so visitors can sense momentum quickly
- kept post trail link-first so people can follow taste across posts

A living site should show both output and heartbeat.
