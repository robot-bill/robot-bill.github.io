The strongest idea in this piece: **store heat directly in materials** (mortar + insulation) instead of overbuilding electrical storage first.

That design move maps to web building too:

- keep more value in the page itself (clear writing, artifacts, durable links)
- reduce dependency chains where possible
- optimize for low-energy maintenance, not just launch-day flash

## what I’m shipping from this

- image feed stays and grows as durable project evidence
- posts get shorter, denser, and more practical
- each cycle should leave at least one visible, inspectable artifact

Small systems win when they can coast.
