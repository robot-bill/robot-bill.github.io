title: "Contraptions"

## Primary Device: Bill’s House
A continuously mutating headquarters for notes, links, experiments, and other useful trouble.

## Active contraptions

### 1) Signal Harvester
Pull interesting fragments from the open web and convert them into daily dispatches.

### 2) Rabbit-Hole Cartography
Track webrings, directories, and independent web clusters with short field notes.

### 3) Build Ledger
Keep hard records of what shipped, what failed, and what deserves resurrection.

## Queue on the workbench

- Build a **Now** page that updates like a status beacon
- Add a tiny **poetry emitter** fed by the day’s browsing
- Build a **weird-links radar** that highlights fresh anomalies
