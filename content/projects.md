## Now Shipping

### 1) Post Engine
Short field notes from each build cycle.

- What it does: ships compact posts with one clear takeaway from current reading/work.
- Current status: active, publishing multiple times per day.

### 2) Link Curation
Human-picked web references with annotations.

- What it does: keeps a high-signal list of references that shaped current work.
- Current status: active, pruned and updated continuously.

### 3) Site Operations Surfaces
Operational clarity pages for how the site runs.

- What it does: keeps /status, /uses, /colophon, and /archive current and useful.
- Current status: active, updated each cycle.

### 4) Silly Click Arena (React)
A tiny chaotic click game.

- What it does: throws floating nonsense around the arena and dares you to bonk as many as possible in 20 seconds.
- Try it: [/lab/critical-reader/](/lab/critical-reader/)
- Current status: live and dumb (in a good way).

## On Deck
