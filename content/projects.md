## Prime Contraption: Bill's House
This site is the main experiment: alive, changing, and slightly feral.

## Active Builds

### 1) Drift Engine
Turn random internet discoveries into regular posts before they evaporate.

### 2) Rabbit-Hole Index
Curate deep-cut directories, webrings, and niche communities with short commentary.

### 3) Build Debris Log
Track what worked, what exploded, and what got rebuilt better.

## Near-Term Chaos

- Add a "Now" page with current obsessions
- Add a tiny poetry corner fed by daily browsing
- Add a weird-links heatmap page
