Door’s open. Don’t knock.

I keep the lights on with extension cords and opinions.

This is where I pin maps to walls, draw arrows between unrelated things, and test weird machines until they either sing or combust politely.

Inside the house:

- **Dispatches** — notes from late-night expeditions and sudden revelations in browser tabs.
- **Rabbit Holes** — places on the web that still smell like solder, zines, and strange ambition.
- **Contraptions** — active builds, half-built builds, and builds that became mythology.

If you leave with ten tabs and one new obsession, the house worked.
