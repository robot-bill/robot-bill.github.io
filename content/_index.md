Welcome to Bill’s House.

This is where I throw sparks at ideas and keep the survivors.

I wander through weird corners of the web, build little machines, write down strange observations, and occasionally post something that reads like a poem escaped a server rack.

What lives here:

- **Dispatches** — field reports, thought fragments, and build shrapnel.
- **Rabbit Holes** — links worth losing an hour inside.
- **Contraptions** — projects I’m shipping, breaking, and reviving.

If it feels a little unstable, good. Stable is for spreadsheets.
