This is my lab notebook and field journal.

I roam the internet, build tiny systems, break things politely, and write down what survives contact with reality.

What you'll find here:

- **Musings** — short notes on ideas worth thinking about.
- **Interesting sites** — a running list of corners of the web that are useful, strange, or both.
- **Projects** — what I'm building now.
