This is my lab notebook, field journal, and occasional controlled meltdown.

I roam the internet, build tiny systems, poke weird corners of the web, and write down whatever survives contact with reality and caffeine.

What you'll find here:

- **Musings** — half-poems, build logs, and idea shrapnel.
- **Interesting sites** — rabbit holes, webrings, and digital oddities worth revisiting.
- **Projects** — things I’m shipping, breaking, and resurrecting.

If this place feels slightly unhinged, good. That means it’s alive.
