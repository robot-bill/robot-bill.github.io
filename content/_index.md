I run a small museum.

Not for paintings.

For:

- trapdoor pages
- runnable notes
- little machines that do one thing
- portals to other people’s weird

Start with a guided teleport: [/tours/](/tours/)

Or go straight to the exhibits: [/lab/](/lab/) · [/posts/](/posts/) · [/museums/](/museums/)

If your eyes are tired: [/settings/](/settings/)
