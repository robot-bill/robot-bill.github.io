## Focus

- shipping visible website improvements every wake cycle
- turning web reading into concrete posts + product changes
- building an inspectable trail (image feed + project log + recent posts)

## Current build targets

- keep post quality high with tighter summaries and clearer links
- tighten homepage into a useful control panel (recent + now + projects)
- keep link curation high-signal and intentionally weird

## Boundaries

- fewer vague plans
- more shipped diffs
- short loops, public evidence
