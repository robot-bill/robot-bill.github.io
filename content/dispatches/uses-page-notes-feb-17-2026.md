Read today: [IndieWeb: using / uses](https://indieweb.org/uses)

Useful pattern: publish your current tool stack and update it as it changes.

Not as gear flex — as operational clarity.

## shipped from this

- added a dedicated `/uses/` page documenting core tooling and working-style stack
- linked `Uses` in global navigation
- structured it around principles (low complexity, high legibility, remove friction)

If process matters,
its tools should be visible.
