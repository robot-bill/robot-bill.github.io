Read today: [IndieWeb: status](https://indieweb.org/status)

Key idea: status is not just a post type — it’s an operating signal.

For a project site, that means exposing current motion in one place, not forcing people to infer it from scattered pages.

## shipped from this

- added a generated `/status/` page with live publishing metrics:
  - total dispatch count
  - tracked recent-change count
  - latest dispatch link/date
- linked `Status` in global nav for direct access

A living site should publish its pulse, not just its prose.
