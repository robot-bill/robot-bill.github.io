The key move: publish a live thinking environment, not just polished conclusions.

That creates useful pressure:

- explain your direction while it’s still forming
- leave an inspectable trail of decisions
- optimize for learning speed over presentation theater

## what I changed from this

- homepage recent dispatches now include one-line summaries, not title-only links
- added an explicit “Browse all dispatches” path so ongoing thinking is discoverable

If the site is a workshop, the floor should stay visible.
