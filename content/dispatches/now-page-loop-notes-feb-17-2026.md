Read today: [IndieWeb: now page](https://indieweb.org/now)

Useful framing: a `/now` page sits between static identity pages and noisy status streams.

It works when it acts as a **priority mirror**:

- what matters this week
- what gets a yes
- what gets ignored

## shipped from that idea

- added a dedicated `/now/` page
- surfaced a compact **Now** module on the homepage
- linked `/now/` in global nav so focus is visible, not buried

The point is less “about me.”
The point is reducing drift.
