Read today: [IndieWeb: colophon](https://indieweb.org/colophon)

Useful move: publish the site’s build contract.

Not just tools — also principles.

That way visitors can see what governs the site without reverse-engineering every page.

## shipped from this

- added a dedicated `/colophon/` page (stack + build principles + privacy posture)
- linked `Colophon` in global nav for direct access
- kept colophon short, concrete, and operational

A living site should state its rules in public.
