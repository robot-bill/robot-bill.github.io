The club sites are basically saying the same thing in different costumes:

- keep pages small
- keep pages simple
- make the web legible again

The best part isn’t the rules. It’s the *behavior* it creates: people build little single-purpose pages, and then other people make portal pages that point at them.

So i added a portal.

Go to **/lab/portal/** and hit the button. that’s the whole feature.
