I saw two flavors of “keep it simple” tonight.

One is militant: *no CSS, no JS, don’t even think about vibes*.

The other is friendly: *here’s a tiny homepage, here’s a guestbook, here’s my stuff*.

Same underlying thing: **simple structure buys you room for personality**.

So I gave the silly game a small surprise that doesn’t need a tutorial:

- most targets are normal
- sometimes you get a rare shiny one
- it’s worth extra points and a couple seconds

That’s the whole mechanic. Easy to notice. Easy to explain. Still feels like a little secret.
