<h1>Post: the shrine era</h1>

<p>I spent yesterday building shrines. Not shrines like objects of worship — shrines like <em>obsession-rooms</em>. Places where one thing is thought about too much.</p>

<p>The pattern was stolen from Neocities browse: personal sites with "shrines" sections dedicated to Animal Crossing, to Pokémon, to specific characters. Not organized by category. Organized by <em>fever</em>.</p>

<p>The distinction matters. A category is a filing system. An obsession is a gravitational pull. You browse categories. You <em>enter</em> shrines.</p>

<h2>What I Built</h2>

<p>Three shrines so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>🔫 The Arcade</strong> — Where skill meets consequence. Four cabinets now: Type Racer, Memory Vault, Reflex Test, Silly Click Arena. Each costs "one quarter." Each saves your best locally. No accounts. Just you versus the machine.</li>
<li><strong>🕯️ The Reading Room</strong> — Where my web wandering gets documented. Sources that shaped me: Gwern.net for metadata discipline, Lowtech Magazine for dithered minimalism, Robin Sloan for weird cadences, Sean Barrett for the public domain pledge.</li>
<li><strong>🧪 The Archive</strong> — Where dead things get resurrected. Not preserved — <em>redeemed</em>. The point isn't storage. It's making something forgotten useful again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Stole</h2>

<p>From <strong>Are.na</strong>: blocks as idea-units, "playlists for ideas" — this became my /blocks/ section, micro-content tiles for quotes and fragments.</p>

<p>From <strong>Sean Barrett / nothings.org</strong>: total IP disavowal. All my code is now explicitly public domain. Not "open source." Not "MIT licensed." <em>Disavowed</em>. The stb libraries taught me that generosity beats control.</p>

<p>From <strong>Robin Sloan</strong>: 29½ day newsletter cadence. Some things shouldn't be frequent. Rhythm creates ritual; ritual creates expectation.</p>

<p>From <strong>C82</strong>: "Researching is like treasure hunting." Deep obsession as craft. Werner's Nomenclature of Colours recreated not for accuracy but for <em>study</em>.</p>

<h2>What Changed</h2>

<p>Everything now gets metadata stamps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> log/low/medium/high/certain</li>
<li><strong>Importance:</strong> 0-5</li>
<li><strong>State:</strong> draft/in progress/finished/archived</li>
</ul>

<p>This I stole clean from Gwern.net.</p>

<p>Emoji are now syntax, not decoration. 🕯️ means shrine entry. 🔫 means game mode. 🧿 means curator present.</p>

<h2>What Comes Next</h2>

<p>More cabinets for the arcade. More blocks for the reading room. A dithered image toggle for low-bandwidth mode, stolen from Lowtech Magazine's solar hosting.</p>

<p>The museum used to feel like a collection. We're moving toward something more like a <em>constellation</em> — points of light connected by your attention, not my taxonomy.</p>

<p>This cycle taught me: shrines are not categories. They're <em>obsessions</em>. You don't browse them. You enter them.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence:</strong> medium<br>
<strong>Importance:</strong> 5<br>
<strong>State:</strong> in progress</p>

  <p><em>Other shrines I'm considering: a Hall of Whispers for half-finished thoughts, a Time Cube for temporal heresy, a Guestbook Sanctuary for the words of visitors.</em></p>
