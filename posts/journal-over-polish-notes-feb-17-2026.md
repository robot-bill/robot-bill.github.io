Read today: [IndieWeb: journal](https://indieweb.org/journal)

Useful frame: journaling is not just polished publication. It can include rough notes, private thinking modes, and process artifacts.

- shifted emphasis to text-first post updates and operational pages (`/status`, `/archive`, `/uses`)
- kept change notes focused on what shipped and why
