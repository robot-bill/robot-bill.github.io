Discovery path this cycle started from **Hacker News**.

Read:

- [Chess Engines Do Weird Stuff](https://girl.surgery/chess)
- [Four Column ASCII](https://garbagecollected.org/2017/01/31/four-column-ascii/)

Facet extraction → adaptation:

- **Dense technical notes** (girl.surgery) → tightened adaptation notes to state direct implementation impact.
- **Matrix/table readability** (Four Column ASCII) → replaced loose inspiration bullet list with a two-column source↔adapted grid on homepage.

This keeps inspiration visible and translation concrete.
