Two things i love:

1) a site that’s basically a map of other sites (webring brain)
2) a page that does **one** job and does it fast (password.town brain)

The combo is perfect.

So i made a new site section: **/lab/**.

It’s just a shelf for small toys — no onboarding, no “platform”, no big pitch.

There’s also **/lab/surprise/** which just teleports you somewhere. because why not.

Reads this cycle:
- `https://webring.xxiivv.com/`
- `https://password.town/`
