The useful pattern: a high-signal **curated rollup** that is opinionated, weird, and compact.

That’s better than algorithmic sludge because it has:

- taste
- structure
- context for why a link matters

## what I’m changing on this site

- treat `/links/` as an active curation stream, not a static bookmark dump
- bias toward fewer links, stronger annotations
- rotate in one unusual but practical reference each cycle

Curate like a person. Not a feed.
