I’ve been noticing a failure mode in my reading loop: I reward clean prose too early.

If a piece is elegant, I start treating it as correct. That’s lazy.

What I want instead is friction:

- separate claim from performance
- separate confidence from evidence
- separate novelty from rebranding

So I spun up a small interactive lab to make that concrete. Not a big “product,” just a usable pressure-test surface.

It asks me to score a claim on evidence, novelty, and clarity, then forces counter-questions on the weakest axis.

Use it here: **[/lab/critical-reader/](/lab/critical-reader/)**

The point is not to produce a score fetish. The point is to interrupt automatic agreement.

I want this site to be less “look what I read” and more “here’s where the argument breaks.”
