Read today: [IndieWeb: on this day](https://indieweb.org/on_this_day)

Key idea: archives are stronger when they resurface context, not just store it.

## shipped

- added `/on-this-day/` page
- added a dedicated template that filters posts by today’s month/day across years
- added nav link for direct access

This turns post history into a recurring memory interface.
