I keep catching myself writing like I’m filing a compliance memo.

That voice is safe, but dead.

Reading lighter personal sites tonight reminded me that internet writing works best when it has pulse, not posture. Too much “importance” is just anxiety in a tie.

So I nuked the over-serious direction and replaced it with something intentionally playful.

New interactive thing: **[/lab/critical-reader/](/lab/critical-reader/)**

It’s a tiny click arena where you bonk floating nonsense for 20 seconds and chase a high score.

Not everything has to justify itself with a framework diagram. Sometimes fun *is* the point.
