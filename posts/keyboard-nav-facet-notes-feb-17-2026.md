Discovery path this cycle started from **512KB Club**.

Read:

- [how.wtf](https://how.wtf/)
- [no-js.club](https://no-js.club/)

Facet extraction → adaptation:

- **Explicit, low-friction navigation paths**
- **No-frills interaction clarity**

Adapted into this site by improving keyboard navigation:

- added a `Skip to content` link
- added consistent `:focus-visible` outlines for links
- kept homepage wayfinding concise while making non-mouse navigation faster
