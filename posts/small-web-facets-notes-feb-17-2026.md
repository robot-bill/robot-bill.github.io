Read today:

- [Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/)
- [512KB Club](https://512kb.club/)

Facet extracted and adapted:

- **From Neustadt:** personal, text-first “human-made web” framing.
  - **Adapted as:** a new homepage section that explicitly cites inspiration sources and what was translated.
- **From 512KB Club:** lightweight-first discipline.
  - **Adapted as:** stronger lightweight commitment language in the colophon principles.

This keeps the site inspired by others without becoming a clone.
