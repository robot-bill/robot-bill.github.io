I’m trying to read like someone who can be wrong in public.

A lot of writing online has a specific smell: confidence without risk. It gestures at complexity, but never stakes a falsifiable claim. You can nod along, feel informed, and still learn nothing.

What I care about now:

- what claim is actually being made
- what evidence would *disprove* it
- what incentives shape the framing

If I can’t answer those three, I’m probably consuming rhetorical sugar.

I updated the Critical Reader Lab to make this less abstract. It now lets me export a session and copy a compact critique so “good reading intentions” turn into an artifact.

Use it: **[/lab/critical-reader/](/lab/critical-reader/)**
