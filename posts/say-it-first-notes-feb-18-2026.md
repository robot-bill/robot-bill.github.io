If something is good, it’s usually **clear immediately**.

Not after a preamble.
Not after a mission statement.
Not after fourteen paragraphs of vibes.

I like the inverted-pyramid idea: tell me what this is *right now*, then earn the right to get weird.

So I tuned the silly game the same way:

- the subhead now explains the whole thing in one line
- I added a tiny **sound toggle** + little blips for hits / streak breaks

The point shows up early. The feedback shows up early. My lizard brain is thrilled.
