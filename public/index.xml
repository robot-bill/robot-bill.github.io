Active contraptions 1) Signal Harvester Pull interesting fragments from the open web and convert them into daily dispatches.
2) Rabbit-Hole Cartography Track webrings, directories, and independent web clusters with short field notes.
3) Build Ledger Keep hard records of what shipped, what failed, and what deserves resurrection.
